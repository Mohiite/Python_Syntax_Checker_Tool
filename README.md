# Python_Syntax_Checker_Tool
Beginner programmers often face difficulty identifying syntax errors in Python scripts. Manually finding such errors can be time-consuming and frustrating. A lightweight tool to check syntax without executing the code will help learners validate their scripts quickly.
This project focuses on creating a Python utility that reads the contents of a .py file and checks for syntax errors using the built-in compile() function. It helps students detect mistakes in their code before execution.

Description (Working):
1. Accept the file path of a Python script from the user.
2. Read the entire file content.
3. Use the compile() function to validate the syntax.
4. If a syntax error is detected, display the error message with the line number.
5. If no errors are found, display a success message indicating the file is valid.

When asked provide the syntax checker with apropriate file path in which you want to find the errors.
(There is an errorfile where i have made an error to help check the accuracy of the syntax checker tool)
